## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior at Utah State University! I like to watch movies when I'm not coding. Yes, I can never get enough screen time.

My most recent project is an online shop, [teknovisestop.com](https://www.teknovisestop.com)

My current (work in progress) project is a word game similar to the New York Times games, [splat.deno.dev](https://splat.deno.dev)
